This is a simple number guessing game developed using Jetpack Compose in Kotlin for Android.
The game prompts the user to guess a random number between 0 and 10. 
The user has up to 5 attempts to guess the correct number. 
If they succeed, they receive a congratulatory message; otherwise, they are informed of the correct number after exhausting their attempts.
